# T-Chatter

A twitch chat client build with Electron and React.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start` / `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

### `yarn watch` / `npm run watch`

Will watch for changes in `src` directory and build when a change is detected.

### `yarn test` / `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `yarn dist` / `npm run dist`

Builds the react and electron projects to the `packages` folder.\
It will create an installer and also a `*-unpacked` folder with the app unpacked.

### `yarn build:react` / `npm run build:react`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
